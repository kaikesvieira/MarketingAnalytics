that a significant majority of customers stayed with the company. This is a positive sign, indicating that customer satisfaction, loyalty, or the value proposition of the company is strong.\n","\n","Low Churn Rate: Since the percentage of customers who left is relatively small, the company seems to be successfully retaining most of its customers. This could be attributed to good customer service, competitive pricing, or an overall positive customer experience.\n","\n","Opportunities for Growth: Although the churn rate is low, it’s still important to analyze the reasons why the small percentage of customers left. This could highlight areas of potential improvement to reduce churn even further.\n","\n","Focus on Customer Retention Strategies: Continue to prioritize retention strategies, as keeping existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Loyalty programs, personalized offers, or proactive customer service could further strengthen retention.\n","\n","Strategic Communication with Stakeholders: This high retention rate is a great achievement and should be communicated to stakeholders as a success. It shows that current strategies are working well, but there’s always room for fine-tuning and preventing any increase in

Why We Check the Variable Summary\n","\n","-Understanding the Data Distribution: Helps in checking whether the data is normally distributed or if there are outliers.\n","\n","-Detecting Anomalies: If any variable has an unusually large range, it might indicate the presence of outliers or incorrect data entries.\n","\n","-Data Preprocessing: Determines which columns might need scaling or transformation based on their spread and ranges.\n","\n","\n","2. Why We Check the Correlation Matrix\n","\n","-Detect Relationships: A strong positive correlation (close to 1) indicates that as one variable increases, the other also increases. A strong negative correlation (close to -1) means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.\n","\n","-Feature Selection: Helps in identifying highly correlated variables. If two variables are strongly correlated, you might consider dropping one to reduce multicollinearity in machine learning models.\n","\n","-Understand Key Drivers: Correlations can help highlight the key variables influencing your target variable (e.g., churn). You can see if certain features are strongly related to customer churn or retention.\n","\n","\n","By observing the correlation between Churn and other features, we can determine which features are most relevant for predicting customer churn. Features with strong positive or negative correlations are likely to be important predictors.The final heatmap plot effectively visualizes these relationships, making it easier to interpret the correlation matrix."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"097b6609","metadata":{"id":"097b6609"},"source":["## Model Building (We will build Decision Tree and Logistics Regression models)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"41deb052","metadata":{"id":"41deb052"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import all the modules for machine learning models\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,accuracy_score,classification_report,precision_score,recall_score,f1_score"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4eab9dcf","metadata":{"id":"4eab9dcf"},"outputs":[],"source":["#splitting train and test data\n","train,test = train_test_split(df1, test_size = .20 ,random_state = 0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6c812764","metadata":{"id":"6c812764"},"outputs":[],"source":["##seperating dependent and independent variables\n","cols    = [i for i in df1.columns if i not in Id_col + target_col]\n","X_train = train[cols]\n","Y_train = train[target_col]\n","X_test  = test[cols]\n","Y_test  = test[target_col]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0be32d48","metadata":{"id":"0be32d48"},"source":["## Logistics Regression"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"fab9a985","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":80},"id":"fab9a985","outputId":"1c0e50fe-e9e4-4563-d752-f90c490c7edc"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-1 {\n","  /* Definition of color scheme common for light and dark mode */\n","  --sklearn-color-text: black;\n","  --sklearn-color-line: gray;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for unfitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-0: #fff5e6;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-1: #f6e4d2;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-2: #ffe0b3;\n","  --sklearn-color-unfitted-level-3: chocolate;\n","  /* Definition of color scheme for fitted estimators */\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-0: #f0f8ff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-1: #d4ebff;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-2: #b3dbfd;\n","  --sklearn-color-fitted-level-3: cornflowerblue;\n","\n","  /* Specific color for light theme */\n","  --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, white)));\n","  --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, black)));\n","  --sklearn-color-icon: #696969;\n","\n","  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n","    /* Redefinition of color scheme for dark theme */\n","    --sklearn-color-text-on-default-background: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-background: var(--sg-background-color, var(--theme-background, var(--jp-layout-color0, #111)));\n","    --sklearn-color-border-box: var(--sg-text-color, var(--theme-code-foreground, var(--jp-content-font-color1, white)));\n","    --sklearn-color-icon: #878787;\n","  }\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 {\n","  color: var(--sklearn-color-text);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 pre {\n","  padding: 0;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-hidden--visually {\n","  border: 0;\n","  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);\n","  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n","  height: 1px;\n","  margin: -1px;\n","  overflow: hidden;\n","  padding: 0;\n","  position: absolute;\n","  width: 1px;\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {\n","  border: 1px dashed var(--sklearn-color-line);\n","  margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;\n","  box-sizing: border-box;\n","  padding-bottom: 0.4em;\n","  background-color: var(--sklearn-color-background);\n","}\n","\n","#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-container {\n","  /* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none;
